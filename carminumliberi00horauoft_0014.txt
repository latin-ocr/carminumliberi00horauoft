2 THE ODES OF HORACE—BOOK I

Returns to Rome. After obtaining a pardon from the
victorious party he devoted himself to peaceful pursuits
in Rome. His paternal estate had been confiscated‚ but
he obtained sufficient money to purchase a clerkship in
the quaestor's office, devoting his leisure to poetry.

Introduced to Maecenas and Augustus. His poenis
attracted the notice of Virgil and VariUS, who intro-
duced him to Maecenas (13. c. 39), the minister of
Augustus, and a generous patron of literature. Horace
soon became his intimate friend and a valued member of
the literary coterie that lived under his patronage‚ and
comprised nearly all the prominent men of talent in
Rome. From Maecenas Horace received a Sabine farm
sufficient to maintain him in comfort for the rest of his
life. To Maecenas also he owed his introduction to
Augustus who had a high opinion of his poems, some of
which were written at his request.

Death. Horace died in B.c. 8, aged nearly fifty-seven.

Appearance. Horace has left us a description of his
appearance. He was short and dark‚ and in later years
grew fat. His health was not always good, and he
suffered from an affliction of the eyeS.

character. Though on the whole frugal and abstemious‚
Horace enj0yed conviviality. Though of a quick temper
he was not malicious, and seems to have been an agree-
able companion and a warm-hcarted friend. He refers
to Virgil with affectionate appreciati0n‚ and he is never
tired of reiterating his gratitude to Maecenas. He was
essentially a man of the world and strongly disclaims
the position of a philosopher3 if anything he was an
Epicurean, but not in a speculative sense of the term.
He was never married.
