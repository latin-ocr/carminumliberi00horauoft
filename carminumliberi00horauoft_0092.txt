80 . NOTEs To HORACE

11. beatus with pereat. Page translates, ‘what is the
wound, what the shaft of which he is the happy victim.’

ι Notice the juxtaposition of beatus and vulnere: this is called

oxymoron (bitter-sweet). cf. Tennyson, Idylls os the Kinq:
‘His honour rooted in dishonour stood,
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true!

13. cessat voluntas: i. e. are you too shy to tell ἱ) (Ad-
ἓνθεεθᾶ to Megilla’s brother). Literally ‘ does your will
alter ‘2’

15. erubescendis, ‘that need cause a blush.’

16. ‘You always sin with love of noble birth: Inyenuo
has a touch of dramatic irony. The young man whispers
the name to Horace and from his reply (ah miser, &c.)‚ it is
evident that his lady-love was not ingenua.

19. laborabas. Wickham compares the Greek ἄρα with
the imperfect z ⁴ you were, it seems, struggling.'

charybdi: this whirlpool‚ the terror of sailors, is taken
to represent the dangers of the youth entangled in the
meshes of a heartless coquette.

21. Thessalis: the Thessalians were famous for witch-
craft.

24. Bellerophon, ordered by the king of Lycia, to destroy
the monster Chimaera, is said to have done so by the
help of the winged horse Pegasus. Chimaera was really
a mountain in Lycia from which flames were always issuing.
The ancient conception of it was a female monster with
the head of a lion, the waist of a goat, and the tail of
a serpent.

ODE XXVIII.

There are different theories as to how this Ode should be
taken: they are briefly discussed in Appendix VII.

1. 'te is the object of cohibent, the subject of which is
parva munera. All that is intended by the first six lines
is that Archytas was a natural philosopher and mathe—
matician.

numero carentis: i. e. countless.

2. cohibent: for meaning see Appendix VII.

3. pulveris. Page well observes, ‘There is an obvious
contrast between his boundless genius and narrow tomb’;
he also quotes Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV, v· 4 t

‘When that this body did contain a spirit.
A kingdom for it was too small a bound3
But now two paces of the vilest earth

Is roem enough.’
