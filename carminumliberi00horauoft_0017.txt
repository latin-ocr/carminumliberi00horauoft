INTRODUCTION 5

'l'he following is Milton's translation of the same

Ode :—

‘what slonder youth, bedew’d with liquid odeum,
Gourts thee on roses in some pleasant eave,
Pyrrha? For whom bind·st thou
In wmths thy golden hair,

‘Phin in thy neatness? Ο how oft shall he

On saith and changed gods complain, and seas
Bough with blaek winds, and storms

Unwontod shall admira 1

‘Who now enjoys thee credulem, all gold,
Who always mut, always amiable

Hopes thoe, of flattering gales
Unmindful. Hapless they

‘'l’ whom thou untried seem'st fair. Me, in my vow'd

Ρίοιιιω, the sacred wall declares to have hung
ΠΥ dank and dropping woeds
'l'o the stem god of sea.’
