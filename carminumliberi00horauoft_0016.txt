4 THE ODES OF HORACE--BOOK Ι

Italian lyre,' he has in many cases improved upon his
models. Ovid calls him numerosus Horatius, ‘Horace of
many metres.’ His philosophy may be trite and com·
monplace3 his passion half-hearted ancl superficial, but
the exquisite workmanship of the Odes will ensure
their claim to recognition as long as Latin literature is
read.

Of the many attempts to translate Horace few can be
said to have achieved any real success. He is a master
of the art of expressing a great deal with a small
expenditure of energy, and a translator has to choose
between spoiling a fine point· by expansion or omitting
it altogether. The best prose translation is that by Lee
and Lonsdale. of verse translations there are many, the
best, perhaps, being that of Conington. Ode I. 5 is given
below as a specimen of this translation :-

‘What slender youth, besprinkled with perfume,
Courts you on roses in some grotto’s shade‘?
Fair Pyrrha, say, for whom
Your yellow hair you braid,

‘So trim‚ so simple! Ah! how oft shall he
Lament that faith can fail, that gods can change,
Viewing the rough black sea
With eyes to tempests strange,

‘Who now is basking in your golden smile,
And dreams of you still fancy-free, still kind,
Poor fool, nor knows the guile
of the deceitful wind!

‘Woe to the eyes you dazzle without cloud
Untried! For me, they show in yonder fane
My dripping garments, vow'd
To Him who curbs the main!
