ODE XI.

‘Do not consult astroloyers about the future : enJoy tho present!

I have ventured to subjoin an attempt to render‘this Ode
in English verse.

Ask not, we may not know, Leuconoe,

the end decreed by God for me, for theo:

and question not Chaldaea’s ancient seers:

far better to eudure with coming years

what shall be, whether many winters more

or this the last that Heaven has in storo,
beneath whose tempests on the rocks in vain
beats the wild force of the Etruscan main.

Our life is short: be wiso: strain clear the wine,
no more for these far distant hopes repine.
While yet we speak, lo! envious time flits past:
snateh the day's pleasure: this may be thy last.

1. ne quaesieris. This form of prohibition is abrupt ; it is
rare in model prose, noli with the infinitivo being the usual
form.

2, 3. Babylonios temptaris numero.. The Chaldeans
were famous for the study of astronomy and astrology.
numeros (not here, as often in poetry, ‘ metre ’) means mathe-
matical calculatione. temptaris is contracted for temptaveris.
For et ue it is more usual to find neve or neu than nec.

ut: exclamatory, ‘ how?

5. i. e. makes the sea spond its strength in uselessly
beating against the immovable rocks.

6. sapias: jussive subjunctive; so belom liques, reseces.

8. carpe: metaphor from plucking flowers.

postero: sc. diei, dative after credula.

ODE XII.

‘Of whom, O Musa of Ηίειὸνῃ, dost thou choose to tell 12 surely first
of Jupiter : then tlte other yods and heroes and miyhty ‘men : and
last, but not least, Λυρκείας]

2. sumis celebrare: see Appendix Ι.

7. temere, ‘blindlyl

9. materna.. The Muse Calliope was the mother of Orpheus.
He was said by his music to make the trees follow him and
the rivers stay their course.
' 11. blandum . . . ducere: see Appendix 11. ⁴ So persuasive
