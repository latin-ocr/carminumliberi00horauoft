86 ἡ NOTES To HORACE

ODE XXXIV.

‘ Once art-infida philosopher, now I retract.- I have heard thunder in
a cloudless sky : (hat was no clashinq os clouds, but the hand mat
Zzfls the humble and overthrow-s· the mund-²

In a passage in the Satires (i. 5) Horace professes himself
a follower of Epicurus; the philosophers of this school did
not deny the existence of gods, but refused to believe that
they interfered in human affairs3 cf. Tennyson :—

‘On the hills like gods together, careless of mankind.

For they lie beside their nectar, and their bolts are

Far ffilblvedthem in the valley, and the clouds are lightly

Rouggrltlegczir golden houses, girdled with the gleaming

wor ,

But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful

song

Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,

Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong.’
His complacent philosophy seems to have received a shock
by hearing a natural phenomenon which he was unable to
explain on scientific grounds.

2. insanientis sapientiam Oxymoron3 cf. 27. 11, and note.
sapientia is technically used of ⁴ philosophy,’ just as in the
Satires Horace uses sapiens = ‘philosopher,’ and stultus = ‘ no
philosopher.' The genitive is dependent on cons-ultus, the
phrase being formed on the model of cur-5³ cons-uuus ‘ a lawyer‚’
where consultus means ‘an adept ‘(11t. ‘one often consulted ’).
Translate ‘ one versed in foolish wisdom.’

4. iterare = repetere: ‘retrace pathe 1 had long left!

6. div-idean cf. Tennyson‚ Dream qsFair Women :—

‘Saw eod divide the night with flying flame,
And thunder on the everlasting hilla’

9. bruta, ‘massiva’

11. ‘The boundaries of Atlas! Atlas was supposed to
support the world on his shoulders.

12. valen for the sentiment cf. ‘He hath put the mighty
from their seat, and hath exalted the'humble and the meek.’
Translate ‘God can change the highest to the lowest, and Η(-
weakens the lofty‚ while He brings that which was hidden
to light.’
