60 ψ NOTES TO HORACE

ODE V.

*Who is wooinq thee now, Pyrrha? Before lony he will find that
thou art saithless‚ however much he trust thee now. Ι know it
mysle from experience!

Ι. multa . . . in rosa, ‘midst many a rose.'

5. simplex munditiis = literally ‘ simple in elegance! The

fidem ε understand mutatam from mutatos ; ‘ will lament the
caprice of your faith and of heaven.'

8. insolens, ‘unaccustomed’ to such treatment. Trans-

9. te fruitur . . . aurea, ‘enjoys the golden hours of thy

at its zenith.

11. sperat, ‘ hopes to find thee.'

13. me tabula, ‘the sacred wall with its votive tablet
shows that I have hung up my dripping garments <in grati-
tude) to the god that rules the ocean!

As throughout above, Pyrrha is compared to a treacherous
sea in which the inexperienced sailor may be drowned.
Horace admits that he has been a victim himself: ‘ you
may see the tablet recording thanks for my escape-⁹ It was
common to place such tablets in temples: in the same way
there are many thousands of tablets at Lourdes placed in
gratitude for miraculous cures.

The offer of the dripping garments was similar to the
custom among slaves of offering their slave dress to a patron
deity in thanks for receiving their freedom.

ODE VI.

· Your prataes, Ayrippa, should be suna by α Varius : I am vo
Epic poet. Love and such liyht themes suit me best?

2. ‘You shall be celebrated by varius, a bird of Homeric
stram, as a hero and conquemn’ †alite is most difficult to
explain, as we should expect ab with Vario if Vario is ablative.
A few other cases are quoted from poetry‚ and we must
regard it as a licence taken by the poet for metrical pur-
poses. Some try to explain this as an ablative absolute, but
