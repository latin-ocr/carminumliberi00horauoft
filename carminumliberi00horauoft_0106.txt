94 ⁴NOTES TO HORACE, BOOK Ι

VII. Ona XXVIII.

ODE 28 has caused endless difficulties to commentators.
Some regard it as a dialogue, some as a monologue.

(Ι) Those who take it to be a dialogue divide the ode
variously at 7, 15, 17, and 21. The best proposals are—

(a) To make the first part (1—20) spoken by Horace,
the rest by the spirit of Archytas. But cohibent in
1. 2 implies that Archytas was buried, unless we render
‘the gift of dust (i. e. the want of it) keeps you
fromdcrossing in Charon's boat.’ But this is very
force .

(b) To make 1—20 spoken by a wandering sailor who
moralizes before Archytas’ tomb, and the rest by the
spirit of a shipwrecked sailor who appears and asks
for burial.

(c) To make the first part spoken by a living sanor,
and the last by the spirit of Archytas, the division being
at 7 17, or 21.

As reg’ards (b) and (c) the main objection to the intro-
duction of a sailor is iudice te in 14; these words, applied
to a sailor, are absurd3 and little less so if spoken by
a sailor to Archytas, as it, and the accompanying lines,
imply greater literary and philosophie knowledge than we
should expect in a sailor.

The objection (in line 2) to making the first part ad-
dressed to Archytas, and the last spoken by him, has been
‹riven above.

ὅ (2) Of those who regard the ode as a monologue some
make Horace the speaker; if this is correct—

(α) Horace is ‘fancifully anticipating the realization
of a danger from which he in another place records
his preservation,’ iii. 4. 27 (ΜΓ. Marshall). This too
seems forced.

(b) More probably, as ΜΓ. Ε. S. Thompson has sug-
gested in the Classical Romam, the ode is an epitaph
{iffgffssffiefssfiossssffi&attefflmfissaffns‘issnffissffiffiiffi
poems.

There is still an objection to this, which applies also
to 2 (a): Tarenti in line 29 looks as if Archytas (the
Tarentine) is speaking ; Neptune, the guardian of Tarentum,
might well be expected to remember kindness shown to au
inhabitant of Tarentum.
