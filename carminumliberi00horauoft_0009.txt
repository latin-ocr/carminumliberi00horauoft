PREFACE

ἠ.-

ΜΥ object in this little book has been to keep in
view the requirements of the student working with
or without a translation for the ordinary public
examinatione, and at- the same time those of the
schoolboy to whom the use of a ,translation is
prohibited. 'Phe former will, I hope, find the
voeabula-y of Proper Names and the Appendices
useful for getting up the grammatical and subject
matter; while in the notes I have translated the

.‚ more difficult passages, so that the average boy
·“ may have enough to exercise his ingenuity without
’.ᾖ finding the task a hopeless one. My aim has been

⁴ that a pupil of ordinary intelligenoe own obtain
a fair knowledge of the book without reference to
any other work on the subject: it seems to me
inconsistent to give a boy a vocabulary, presumably
to save him the unnecessary labour of turning over
the leaves of a Lexicon‚ and yet refer him to

a Classical Dictionary for historical allusione.
