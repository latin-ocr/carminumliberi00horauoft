curule aedileship, the praetorship, and the consulship. For

t112. Attalicis conditionibus, ‘by (offering) the wealth of
an Attalus: Attalus was the name of three kings of Per-
gamus, whose wealth was proverbial.

13. dimoveas, ‘you would never tempt.' The second
person is used indefinitely = ‘any one? The subjunctive is
conditional, being the apodosis of an unexpressed protasiS,
‘ if you were to try.'

cypria: ‘Cyprian ' would be a familiar epithet as
applied to ships, for Cyprus had an important trade position.
The use of proper names and adjectives derived from them
is typical of Horace3 examples occur in nearly every line.
As all such references would be at once recognized by
a Roman ear, the effect is to make his style the more vivid.

16. otium et oppidi . . . rura sui: best taken as Hendiadys.
‘the peaceful fields around his native town.’ See Appendix

18. indocilis . . . pati, ‘untaught to endure.’ For infini-
tive see Appendix ΙΙ.

cavalry, the tuba a straight trumpet used by the infantry.

24, 25. bellaque matribus detestata, ‘and wars so hateful
to mothers.’ For the dative matribus see Appendix V.
detestata is passive, though detestor is deponent. This is not

regular Latin for ‘in the open air!
