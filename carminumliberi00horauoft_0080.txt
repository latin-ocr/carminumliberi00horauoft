37. animaeque magnae prodigum, ‘ who so freely gave
away his noble life‚' lit. ‘ lavish of.’

39. insigni, ·' ennobling’ ; so in l. 5.

41. incomptis. The Romans did not employ barbers till
about Rc. 300. Hence ‘unkempt locks ’ and beards are with
them typical of antiquity.

42. tulit. The subject is paupertas and again fundus. When

personally taken part. Later emperors were voted triumphs
on the slightest pretext. ·

59. parum cantia i. e. unholy.

dtfficile is used of an unsociable person.

6. †manet. The MSS. are divided between manet and
